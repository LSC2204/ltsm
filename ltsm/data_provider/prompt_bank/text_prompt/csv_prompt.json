To explore the granularity on the Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) problem, different subsets are created, {ETTh1, ETTh2} for 1-hour-level and ETTm1 for 15-minutes-level. Each data point consists of the target value ”oil temperature” and 6 power load features. The train/val/test is 12/4/4 months.",
